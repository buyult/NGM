## Some Things to Know

---------------------------------
NGM1.py shows the code from Subsection 4.3.

NGM2.py shows the code from Subsection 4.2.

---------------------------------
- We save the weights of one randomized experiment to make it easy to see the results quickly, and you can use it directly. It will be somewhat inconsistent with the average of the paper's display statistics.


- When using time delay NGM, you can modify lr, number of neurons, and adjust the termination iteration conditions based on different datasets.
